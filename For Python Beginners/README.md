# For beginners who use Python for the first time:

There are many resources available online to help you get started with Python. Examples include:

* w3schools.com: [Python Tutorial](https://www.w3schools.com/python/)
* Edureka: [Python Tutorial â€“ A Comprehensive Guide to Learn Python Programming](https://www.edureka.co/blog/python-tutorial/#ide)
* Github repo: [Getting started with Python](https://github.com/microsoft/c9-python-getting-started)

I recommend using an integrated development environment (IDE) for editing and running Python scripts, inluding those in this repo. Beginners may find [Jupyter Notebook](https://jupyter.org/) easy to use. You can install [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/distribution/) to help you manage the environment: Jupyter Notebook will be available after you install Anaconda, and many standard Python packages will be already installed as well.

Other widely used IDEs include [PyCharm](https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/) and [Spyder](https://www.spyder-ide.org/). They provide additional features, but are probably not the easiest ones to start with for beginners.

## To run the code in this repo
You can open the .py files in this repo using your preferred IDEs or simply copy and paste the scripts.

Users of Jupyter Notebook can also take the following steps to import the script from a .py file into a .ipynb file: 1) Upload the .py file to the desired folder; 2) Create a new notebook; 3) Execute a cell in the new notebook containing `%load filename.py` (for more information, see [Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/a/21034906)).*
