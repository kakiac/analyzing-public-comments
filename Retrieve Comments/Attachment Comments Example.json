As the air pollution control agency for the fourth most  populous county in the U.S., MCAQD permits and inspects thousands of pollution sources and  maintains an extensive network of air pollution monitors.    Near-Road Minimum Monitoring Requirements    As part of the 2010 N02 National Ambient Air Quality Standard rulemaking (75 FR 6474), the EPA  promulgated revisions to the requirements for minimum numbers of ambient  N0  2  monitors  which  included new monitoring near major roads in larger urban areas, requirements to characterize N02  concentrations representative of wider spatial scales in larger urban areas, and monitors intended to  characterize  N0   2 exposur es  of  susceptible   and  vulnerable  populations.   Nationwide,  over  130  new  N0 2 monitors were to be installed in three (3) phases.    During Phase 1 and Phase 2, MCAQD installed two new near-road monitoring sites to supplement  the existing three N0 2 monitors in the monitoring network.    EPA's evaluation of the Phase 1 and Phase 2 near-road site data (as of December 2015) concluded  that near-road sites are indeed located at maximum concentration locations consistent with rule and  guidance, confirmed that higher population areas have higher mobile source emissions than lesser  populated areas, and that all existing near-road monitoring sites are \\\"well below\\\" the N0 2 NAAQS.    Subsequently and as supported by the evaluation of Phase 1 and Phase 2 data, in 2016 E PA  promulgated a Revision to the Near-road N0 2 Minimum Monitoring Requirements (81 FR 96381)  removing Phase 3 of the near-road network.              1001 North Central Avenue I Suite 125 I Phoenix, Arizona 85004  Samantha K. Dravis  Da te: May 12, 2017      Page 2 of 2        MCAQD evaluates its monitoring network to determine that the data collected not only measures  our performance against the National Ambient Air Quality Standards (NAAQS), but also serves a  public benefit for research and to inform Maricopa County citizens of the local air qua lity.  Fortunately, the N02 data collected from the five N0 2 monitors in the network are consistently well  below the N0 2 N AAQS. Under existing rule, the two near-road sites in MCAQD's network must be  operated even if the data are of little or no public health benefit.    Thus, and for the rational that EPA removed Phase 3 from the near-road monitoring requirements,  MCAQD requests that EPA review the 2010 N0 2 National Ambient Air Quality Standard  rulemaking, reflect on the available near-road data, and work with stakeholders to assess whether the  minimum N0 2 monitoring requirements are resulting in public health benefit in light of what has  been observed to date and the continued cost to operate these additional monitoring sites.

Washington, DC 20250\\u20131021    Identifying Regulatory Reform Initiatives, Federal Register Vol. 82, No. 135, Monday, July 17, 2017,  Pages 32649-32650      The Cheese Importers Association of America (CIAA) appreciates the opportunity to submit these  comments in response to the notice published in the Federal Register on Monday, July 17, 2017, asking  for ideas on how USDA \\u201c\\u2026can provide better customer service and remove unintended barriers in our  programs in ways that least interfere with our customers.\\u201d  This notice follows Executive Order 13777,  \\u201cEnforcing the Regulatory Reform Agenda\\u201d seeking to identify rules that, in part, are \\u201coutdated,  unnecessary, or ineffective.\\u201d  CIAA strongly recommends the elimination of 7 CFR \\u00a76.25(b) (the rule)  because it threatens the business of importing high\\u2010quality specialty cheeses, and we believe meets the  test of being outdated, unnecessary, or ineffective.        CIAA submitted comments in both 2013 and 2015 when the rule was under review, and made the same  recommendation.  The rule has been suspended several times, and should be abandoned given the  vagaries of international markets and variable consumer demand.   Additionally, there have been instances  beyond the control of license holders when holders have been unable to use their country quota. Importers  should not be penalized for them.      As we said in our 2013 comments in response to the ANPR, the \\u00a76.25(b) license reduction provision  erroneously assumes strong demand for dairy imports. Major changes in market conditions have at times  prevented historical license holders from using their full license amounts. In prior years, a weak U.S. dollar;  reductions in European export subsidies; weather factors in major dairy producing countries, such as  Australia, New Zealand, and the EU; and a deteriorating global economy all weighed against dairy imports.  Between 2004 and 2011, tonnage of cheese imports subject to licensing requirements dropped 41% \\u2010 from  125 million kg of cheese to 74 million kg. In the face of this sharp decline, historical license holders struggled  to avoid the 50% threshold of \\u00a76.25(b) that could have caused permanent reductions in their allotment.   These circumstances were unforeseen, and could occur again in the future.  In recent years we have seen  increases in import volumes, largely due to a strong dollar.  However, as currency exchange rates fluctuate,  we can just as easily see a drop in imports due to price considerations.      We agree that it is important that trade be expanded rather than contracted, and we are concerned that the  loss of historical license allocation goes against this goal.  Development of the imported specialty cheese  market requires substantial investment. Historical license holders, many of them small business owners,  have worked for years to build sustainable, value-added businesses and develop demand for specialty  imported cheeses in the U.S. Their long\\u2010term investments in affinage, product promotion, and supply and  distribution chain development are substantial.    The historical import license system is beneficial because it can also result in domestic production of new  types of cheeses that may have previously been unknown or in limited demand by American consumers.   For example:   \\uf0b7  Arla Foods was formed in 2000 when the largest dairy companies in Denmark and Sweden merged.   The Danish company had an office here in the U.S. that for many years had been focusing on  building up the market for their high quality Danish dairy products; Blue cheese, Havarti, Danish  Butter, etc.  They were very successful, and over the years Danish cheese became a staple on the  American market.  This success was in large part due to the fact that they were able to reliably and  continuously import their premium products over the long term.  Historical import licenses made  this possible.  In 2006, Arla acquired their first dairy here in the U.S. and began making variations  of their popular Danish-style cheeses here in America.  Arla has enjoyed great success,  significantly investing in and growing their domestic production along with its import business.  \\uf0b7  Similarly, Schuman Cheese (previously Arthur Schuman, Inc.) was founded to bring Italian cheeses  to the American market.   Schuman Cheese now has expanded capabilities to complement its  original import business as a cheese maker, processor and product innovator.  The same argument  about historical licenses allowing for the company's growth applies in this case.  \\uf0b7  After successfully importing various Swiss cheese delicacies from Switzerland for many years for  the American market, Emmi Roth USA has now expanded their business and is producing various  domestic cheeses at two manufacturing facilities in Wisconsin. Emmi Roth USA continues to grow  both businesses and knowing that the company can count on historical import licenses allows them  to continuously plan and market both the importing and domestic business for the long term.    Because CIAA believes that license reduction can be the \\u201cunintended barrier\\u201d that the Executive Order  seeks to remove, we respectfully urge and recommend that 6.25(b) be eliminated.      The CIAA looks forward to continuing to work with you on improving systems to facilitate responsible trade  that responds to market conditions.

\"**~ National  ~ Fa~mers  ~ Un1on  UNITED TO GROW fAMilY AGRICUlTURE  Sonny Perdue, Secretary  United States Department of Agriculture  Office of Budget and Program Analysis  Jamie L. Whitten Building  Room 101-A  1400 Independence Ave. SW  Washington, DC 20250  September 14, 2017  Identifying Regulatory Reform Initiatives  Dear Secretary Perdue:  National Farmers Union (NFU) appreciates the opportunity to present the Office of the Secretary with  comments in response to its request for information, \\\"Identifying Regulatory Reform Initiatives\\\"  published at 82 Fed. Reg. 32,649 (July 17, 2017). NFU has nearly 200,000 family farmer, rancher, and  fishermen members nationwide and organized divisions in 33 states. We have supported family  agriculture and rural communities since 1902: \\\"the family farm is the keystone of a free, progressive,  democratic national society, as well as a strong America, and is the basis of a safe, secure and stable  food system.\\\"1  NFU values the Farm Service Agency's (FSA) commitment to its mission, serving our nation's farmers and  ranchers professionally, efficiently, equitably, and in a manner that is customer, taxpayer, and  employee-friendly. We are a grassroots organization, and our policy positions are directed by an  annually recurring, vigorously democratic parliamentary process. Our policy supports FSA in its mission,  calling for a \\\"consistent, sufficient funding mechanism ensuring loan funding allocations are available to  all approved FSA loans in a timely fashion,\\\" \\\"streamlining and digitizing loan programs and/or appeals  processes,\\\" and \\\"increasing consistency and education on the county and state appeals process and FSA  servicing responsibilities to the borrower.\\\"2 We laud FSA for requesting information pursuant to  providing better customer service and removing unintended barriers to participation in FSA programs  and anticipate participating in each cut-off period. We hope to be valued partners as FSA attempts to  reduce unnecessary paperwork and streamline processes, ultimately improving the experience of  farmer borrowers and improving FSA's ability to keep America's agriculture growing.  1 Policy of the National Farmers Union, https://nfu.org/2017-policy/.  2/d.  1  .W F Str~\\u00b7et NW Suit<: 300 W.:oshington. DC 20001 P: 202.534.1600 F: 202.534.10:.54 wwv1.nfu.or9  **~ National  ~ Fa~mers  ~ Un1on  UNITED TO GROW fAMILY AGRICULTURE  In this first comment period, NFU requests that the customer service and training materials FSA uses  with county offices be made publicly available. Through our work with family farmers, we have learned  that certain factors which distinguish working with FSA from other lenders are not getting across to  prospective borrowers as uniformly as NFU and FSA would hope. For example, some NFU members who  applied for, or considered applying for, FSA loans did not know:  \\u2022  FSA is obligated to make loans to qualifying applicants if sufficient funds are available;  \\u2022  staff in county offices are required to help customers in need of assistance with application  forms; or  \\u2022  how to report a negative customer service experience.  These unique characteristics are important for FSA customers to know; they could impact a family  farmer's decision on whether or how to approach FSA about any of its programs. The FSA handbooks  now available online,3 while very helpful in illuminating critical processes like loan making and servicing,  do not explain how FSA staff communicate with customers around the Agency's programs. In order to  provide FSA with useful advice on these topics, we would like to review the customer service and  training materials used in county and state offices. We anticipate making informed recommendations,  such as combining production and financial history forms for more streamlined application and  processing experiences, but have determined that more information on the Agency's training and  customer service protocols will enhance our responses to this request for information.  NFU also urges FSA to make services available online. Posting interactive, diagnostic questionnaires to  help prospective applicants determine basic eligibility, or some portion of the application process, would  reduce frustrating, unnecessary trips to county offices. Prospective customers could also use such  resources to arrive better prepared at initial meetings. These efforts would reduce paperwork by  preventing applications that will clearly be unsuccessful. Again, the regulations, guidance and  handbooks that are currently available for public review are not as useful as customer service and  training materials may be in the dialogue NFU would like to establish with FSA in pursuit of improving  service to farmers and ranchers.  If the customer service and training materials could be made readily available to the public, NFU would  review these materials and consult with FSA customers in our network to ensure key aspects of  customer service are accurately executed. We would consider asking FSA to issue guidance to state and  county offices to remind employees of certain actions they should take to make interactions with  3 https://www.fsa.usda.gov/FSA/webapp?area=home&subject=empl&topic=hbk  2  *\\u00b7~ National  ~ Far:mers  ~ Un1on  UNlll.DTO GROW FAMILY AGRICUll UR\\u00a3  customers more efficient, much as Notice FLP-765 reminded employees \\\"to prioritize their efforts to  focus on processing new loan requests and servicing distressed loan accounts.\\\"4  Thank you for your consideration of these comments. We look forward to your response. NFU will  continue to work on additional comments to be submitted in subsequent cut-off periods and would be  pleased to converse with FSA on improving services through any other venue in the meantime.  4 \\\"Guidance on Direct and Guaranteed Loan Making and Servicing Actions\\\" 16 June 2017.  https:/ /www. fsa. usda.gov /lnternet/FSA_Notice/flp _765.pdf  3  \", \"USDA-2017-0002-0178_1\":

Whitten Building, Room 101-A  1400 Independence Avenue, S.W.  Washington, D.C. 20250  Re: 7 CFR Subtitles A and B; 9 CFR Chapters I, II, and Ill  Dear Sir or Madam:  United Egg Producers (UEP) submits these comments in response to a request for  information published by the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) entitled  \\\"Identifying Regulatory Reform Initiatives\\\" (82 FR 135, July 17, 2017). UEP is a farmer- owned cooperative whose members independently market more than 90% of all eggs  produced in the United States.  UEP and its members value their relationship with USDA and its individual agencies.  We work together with multiple agencies, including the Agricultural Marketing Service  (AMS), the Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service (APHIS), the Food Safety and  Inspection Service (FSJS) and the Foreign Agricultural Service (FAS), among others.  These agencies perform critical tasks that directly benefit egg producers, further  processors, our customers in retail, food service and food manufacturing, and the  general public.  UEP members have held several discussions about USDA regulations that could be  modified without compromising agency missions, and we submit the following  suggestions.  Base the Frequency of Shell Egg Surveillance Program Inspections on Risk  Four times a year, AMS inspects all shell egg packing plants under the Shell Egg  Surveillance Program, which is mandated by the Egg Products Inspection Act (21 USC  1034(d)). These inspections promote both egg quality and food safety. While the law  instructs the Secretary of Agriculture to carry out quarterly inspections, the same law  also provides authority to grant exemptions from its provisions (21 USC 1044 (a)).  United Egg Producers  6455 E. Johns Crossing, Ste. 410  Johns Creek, Georgia 30097  770-360-9220  www.unitedegg.com  Government Relations Office  Cornerstone Government Affairs  300 Independence Avenue, SE  Washington, DC 20003  (202) 448-9500  Government Relations Office  Watson Green LLC  1010 Wisconsin Ave. NW, Ste. 350  Washington, DC 20007  (202) 384-1840  At the time the Egg Products Inspection Act was enacted, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) had  not yet promulgated its Egg Safety Rule (21 CFR Parts 16 and 118). This rule has been successfully  implemented by FDA and the egg industry, and FDA regards it as a success in promoting food safety. To  a degree, the Egg Safety Rule has rendered the Shell Egg Surveillance Program redundant.  UEP recommends that USDA consider two alternatives. First, the Department could determine that in  light of the Egg Safety Rule and numerous private-sector quality control and food safety programs, the  Shell Egg Surveillance Program is unnecessary unless problems are found in a plant during regular  inspections to ensure proper refrigeration (these inspections are required separately from quarterly  Shell Egg Surveillance Program inspections, and are carried out pursuant to 21 USC 1034(e)).  In the alternative, USDA could use its exemptive authority for individual plants with an outstanding food  safety record, so that they would be inspected fewer than four times per year. We believe that either  alternative would permit AMS to use its personnel more efficiently and reduce regulatory burdens on  producers without compromising food safety.  Grant Certification of Cage-Free Status on a Similar Basis to Other Certifications  AMS certifies various label claims for eggs in its voluntary grading program. These may include  vegetarian diets, no use of animal by-products in feed, and numerous others. For such claims, AMS  requires written verification by the producer, but does not inspect or audit feed facilities. By contrast, a  claim of cage-free production does require an audit, at the producer's expense.  In most if not all cases, producers making these label claims are participating in a private-sector  certification program, such as those administered by various humane groups. These groups all have  procedures to verify the claims, independent of AMS's role in approving labels. In that sense, the AMS  audit requirement is duplicative and unnecessary.  UEP recommends that AMS require producer verification for cage-free claims in those cases where the  producer is already participating in a recognized third-party certification or verification program.  Better Accommodate Customer Preferences in the National Organic Program  A number of UEP members produce organic eggs and therefore are subject to regulations of the  National Organic Program (NOP) at 7 CFR 205. UEP has become aware of a situation in which the  current interpretation of these regulations creates an unnecessary restriction on the acquisition and  marketing practices of a major retail customer.  This retailer sources organic eggs from more than one producer. All the producers from whom the  retailer purchases eggs are certified under NOP rules. The producers, who are independent of each  other, utilize two separate certifying agencies.  For reasons of cost and product consistency, the retailer wishes to sell the producers' eggs in a single  carton that would clearly identify both certifiers and the egg operations from which the eggs may have  come. To this point, NOP's informal guidance has been that this practice is not allowed.  Allowing a carton of this type would not in any way compromise the role of each farm's certifier, who  would continue to ensure the integrity of the organic eggs in exactly the same way as at present. Since  the retailer's request could be accommodated without any compromise to certification procedures, UEP  recommends that NOP issue guidance or otherwise inform producers that arrangements of this type are  permitted.  UEP thanks USDA for its consideration of our views.

These practices show signs which appear to be beneficial to some operators to the detriment of other operators and to the local community. These questionable practices will be listed knowing that there are overlapping and inter-tonguing areas where practices affect multiple types of operations and harvest objectives. As a result of number 13 below we have volunteered to write down their concems and present them widely so that changes may be made in these processes outlined below that will improve practices and give some equity to the timber industry in our area of the Malheur National Forest. Stewardship Programs (SP), Stewardship Grants (SG) and Timber Sales 1. Stewardship revenues qo to the General Fund and not to the local sommunities. A Recent stewardship program in Harney County harvested around 200 MM board feet of timber with No revenues going to the CountY. 2. There is no revenue sharing on biomass. A recent SP paid the contractor for the thinning of biomass and then the contractor owned the biomass to sell at a time of his choosing. 3. There is no stumpaqe charge for merchantable trees in the recent SP's. The contractor essentially is getting paid twice for the work he is doing. 4. Arecent id the contractor hour vs bv I . This system is a virtual invitation for billing abuse and is difficult if not impossible to audit. 5. SP sizes and time limitations are such that a small operator is at an extreme disad unable to bid on these. Timber sales can do the same kinds of things as SP's but can be let out on a smaller scale, so more small operators will have a chance to successfully bid on them. In addition, the revenues from timber sales retum back to the local county. 6. The 's and conl n \\\"best value\\\" highly subjective and often blatant cronyism or nepotism. The quality of the work can be controlled by proper oversight and sale requirements. Opening these contracts up to multiple operators both makes the costs more competitive and builds a larger contractor base and industry. ins of on the mill. The mill will be dictated to by the large contractor so the smaller contractor may or may not ever see a mill contract for the duration of the large SP. n leads not reality. of abuse by the contractor. Again here, timber sales are marked by the agency and thus there is opportunity for oversight and audits of the harvest. It has been stated that SP's do not have to be advertised in the local media but only via the internet. Timber sales must be advertised in the local paper and other available media. Both SP's and timber sales should be advertised the same in order for all to have fair notification. the his 9. 10. SG's and Ti the con is allowed to k for timber. The agency then tums around and writes a 1099 for the entire stumpage and the contractor also gets a 1099 from the logs hauled to the mill. This is double taxation. 1 1. On a timber sale the agencli marks the sale with no quality control on the marking team. Often there are trees marked with no stump shots. Missing one stump shot per 100 trees creates a huge potential liability for the contractor over the entire sale. t2. good tree? 13. Maybe the most troubling of all this is that the industry has been weakened to the point where the remaining small loggers are afraid of reprisals against them if they raise complaints about unfair or negligent practices exercised by the regulating agency. Without the ability to trust that their concerns will be fairly treated they have, or perceive to have, no way to stand up for their valid rights as contractors! Questions that need to be asked about Stewardship and Timber Sale programs 1. Why is there no revenue sharing on the biomass when the contractor is already paid to remove it? 2. What part do non-profits have in the revenue stream off a stewardship grant? 3. Who audits the SP performance and the stewardship program invoicing? 4. Why is it necessary to create long term stewardships when the chance to monopolize the mill contracts is so likely? 5. Why can't timber sales contain the same service work and biomass conditions as a stewardship program? 6. Why is acreage often added to a timber sale in order to qualiff it for a Stewardship Program? 7 . Why is the agency allowed to tax the contractor for stumpage that the contractor already traded to the agency for service work? 8. Why is there a practice to advertise stewardship programs differently than timber sales? 9. Why is there insufficient quality control on timber sale marking by the agency? 10. Why is there often no stump differentiation between a good merchantable tree and a non-merch tree?? We believe the local counties, the USFS and the USBLM need to take a close look at these concerns and establish a process to correct or modify these programs so that the use of our forest resources is for the maximum benefit of the community, its working force and its people rather than a few select operators.

This method of safety testing is an  outdated, highly-variable, non-specific, and insensitive way of ensuring the safety of veterinary  biologics. It is estimated that, in a given five-year period, less than 0.1% of US batches are  identified as potentially unsafe via these animal tests, while at the same time involving over  345,000 animals and costing manufacturers over $20 million (see included spreadsheet for annual  values).    There is widespread support for elimination of animal batch release safety testing among  manufacturers, regulators, animal rights activist, and the international community (see additional  information on VICH guidelines). The traditional large-scale Field Safety Tests conducted  directly in target species prior to licensure, followed by enhanced monitoring of  pharmacovigilance data on marketed serials (Docket Number APHIS-2014-0063 VSTA Records  and Reports Specific to International Standards for Pharmacovigilance) is a more practical  approach. Additionally, manufactures are required to prepare veterinary biologicals within a  series of defined parameters to ensure consistent production.    The international community of vaccine regulatory authorities and manufacturers question the  validity of animal batch safety testing (ABST).  The Veterinary International Cooperation on  Harmonization (VICH) is an international organization working to harmonize technical  requirements, and APHIS is on the Steering Committee. Two VICH guidelines focus on target  animal batch safety testing (GL #50 & GL #55) and state: \\u201cOver the past two decades, the  relevance of batch safety tests has been questioned by representatives of regulatory authorities  and vaccine manufacturers.\\u201d The VICH GL# 50 covers the criteria to waive the requirements for  target animal batch safety testing in inactivated vaccines and has been finalized and approved by  all VICH participants, including APHIS.

However,  implementation GL# 50 by APHIS via Veterinary Services Memo 800.115 has been in such a  manner as to discourage companies from seeking exemptions to the regulations that require target  animal batch safety tests.  The European Union no longer requires target animal batch safety  tests.    Alignment with International Norms  As presented at the May 2018 OIE World Assembly of Delegates, international guidelines are  more focused on non-animal testing as a general rule. The OIE\\u2019s Terrestrial Animal Health Code  is targeted for material changes to its ABST guidance, with waivers for such requirements  elevated to \\u201croutine\\u201d granting in the newly revised language. The two VICH guidelines  mentioned earlier go into great detail on reducing animal testing in veterinary biologics as  previously described.    US regulatory authorities are widely viewed as pragmatic, data-driven, evidence-based entities on  the international stage, and modernizing safety testing requirements to more closely mirror those  of the rest of the world would further this status. Eliminating the requirements for routine ABST  for every veterinary biological serial release would be a good first step in this direction.

Box 216   Klamath Falls, Oregon  97601  www.familyfarmallinace.org    December 4, 2018    Office of Budget and Program Analysis  U.S. Department of Agriculture  Whitten Building, Room 101-A  1400 Independence Avenue SW  Washington, D.C.  20250  Transmitted via e-mail to: regulations@obpa.usda.gov  Re: \\u2018\\u2018Identifying Regulatory Reform Initiatives\\u2019\\u2019  To Whom it May Concern:     On behalf of the Family Farm Alliance (Alliance), thank you for this opportunity to submit  formal comments regarding regulatory reform at the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA).  The Alliance is a grassroots organization of family farmers, ranchers, irrigation districts, and  allied industries in 16 Western states.  The Alliance is focused on one mission: To ensure the  availability of reliable, affordable irrigation water supplies to Western farmers and ranchers. We  are also committed to the fundamental proposition that Western irrigated agriculture must be  preserved and protected for a host of economic, sociological, environmental, and national  security reasons \\u2013 many of which are often overlooked in the context of other national policy  decisions.      There are critical issues that the Western family farmers and ranchers we represent are  confronted with at this time.  At the top of the list is the daunting number of administrative  policy initiatives that are facing Western agricultural producers. These types of federal water  resources actions and regulatory practices could potentially undermine the economic foundations  of rural communities in the arid West by making farming and ranching increasingly difficult.   American family farmers and ranchers for generations have grown food and fiber for the world,  and we will have to muster even more innovation to meet this critical challenge. That innovation  must be encouraged rather than stifled with new federal regulations and uncertainty over water  supplies for irrigated farms and ranches in the rural West.       2 | P a g e     Background  On February 24, 2017, President Trump signed Executive Order (E.O.) 13777\\u2014Enforcing the  Regulatory Reform Agenda, which established a federal policy to alleviate unnecessary  regulatory burdens on the American people. The E.O. directs federal agencies to establish a  Regulatory Reform Task Force (Task Force). One of the duties of the Task Force is to evaluate  existing regulations and make recommendations to the USDA Secretary regarding their repeal,  replacement, or modification. The E.O. further calls on the Task Force to seek input and other  assistance, as permitted by law, from entities significantly affected by Federal regulations,  including State, local, and tribal governments, small businesses, consumers, non-governmental  organizations, and trade associations on regulations that meet some or all of the criteria above.     Overview of Family Farm Alliance Recommendations    We appreciate that USDA has extended the public comment period to help its Task Force's  evaluation of existing regulations. Our recommendations are aimed at Natural Resources  Conservation Service (NRCS) and U.S. Forest Service (USFS), the two USDA agencies our  members closely interact with. They are grouped into five categories:    \\uf0b7 Principles, Requirements and Guidelines (PR&G) and Related Agency-Specific  Procedures for federal investments in Water Resources (USDA Departmental Regulation  DR 9500-013);   \\uf0b7 National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) Processes Associated with Forest Health  (regulations at 36 CFR part 220, Forest Service Manual 1950, and Forest Service  Handbook 1909.15);   \\uf0b7 NEPA Processes Associated with New Water Development Projects (7 CFR PART 1b);   \\uf0b7 2015 Clean Water Rule \\u2013 \\u201cWaters of the U.S.\\u201d (80 FR 37054, June 29, 2015)  \\uf0b7 NRCS Water Conservation Programs (7 CFR Chapter VI)    In this document, we attempt to be as specific as we can, and wherever possible, provide a  Federal Register (FR) or Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) citation when referencing a  regulation or directive. We have identified areas where regulations should be repealed, replaced  or modified. Wherever possible, we note if jobs will be eliminated or job creation inhibited by  certain regulations. We seek to explain how some of these regulations and policies are outdated,  unnecessary or ineffective, or impose costs that exceed benefits.     Principles, Requirements and Guidelines (PR&G) and Related Agency-Specific Procedures  for federal investments in Water Resources (USDA Departmental Regulation DR 9500-013  and Departmental Manual 9500-013)     As a result of a congressional directive in the Water Resource Development Act (WRDA) of  2007, the Obama Administration\\u2019s White House Council on Environmental Quality (CEQ)  developed Principles, Requirements and Guidelines (PR&G) for federal investments in water    3 | P a g e     resources. These PR&Gs were originally intended to accelerate Corps of Engineers\\u2019 water  project approvals, reduce costs, and support water infrastructure projects with the greatest  economic and community benefits. These new updates to the original Principles and Guidelines  (P&G) called for in the 2007 WRDA had contemplated that the Corps of Engineers, rather than  the White House CEQ, would provide the lead on this endeavor. Instead, these PR&Gs were  expanded and broadened by CEQ to cover all federal agencies with water infrastructure  development authority, including USDA. They overly emphasize the value of healthy  ecosystems and encourage nonstructural options, such as expanding wetlands to manage  stormwater and flood runoff, over traditional and time-proven solutions like building levees and  dams to provide solutions to flooding, water supply and management problems.   While some environmental groups say the CEQ-driven effort reflected a deeper understanding of  \\u201cthe true costs\\u201d associated with water resource development projects, many in the regulated  community believed instead that adding such requirements to the water project planning process  would hinder and even stop key projects that are needed to meet rising water demands in fast- growing regions of the Nation.  And, placing a subjective \\u201cvalue\\u201d on environmental impacts of a  project could elevate the \\u201ccost\\u201d of a project beyond the projected \\u201cbenefits\\u201d in a new P&G benefit- cost analysis.   Federal laws like the ESA, Clean Water Act, and NEPA already provide sufficient (and some  might say overburdening) requirements for mitigation of environmental damage from water  development projects. Overlaying these new, subjectively-derived set of values reflected in the  PR&Gs on virtually every federal action that has a nexus to water management goes beyond the  intent of Congress and could have a crippling effect on Western water management activities at  all levels and for all uses. It remains unclear how the various agencies involved with water  infrastructure will mesh implementation of individual agency guidelines on projects that involve  more than one federal agency. The new guidelines could bring federal water project development  to a halt.   The new PR&G overlay a whole new \\u201cvalue set\\u201d, not just on new projects, but also on every  federal action that has a nexus with water. The PR&G and subsequent Agency Specific Procedures  (ASP) developed for individual agencies go beyond the legislative intent of Congress stated in the  2007 WRDA. The ASP and PR&Gs could significantly impede water management, conservation  and development activities in the Western United States by adding significant bureaucratic layers  onto already complex federal environmental and engineering decision making processes.  They  are biased towards nonstructural and demand management strategies and could render future  federal water infrastructure investments hopelessly bound in red tape, economic uncertainty and  indecision.   At USDA, Departmental Regulation DR 9500-13 Conducting Analyses Under the Principles,  Requirements, and Guidelines for Water and Land Related Resources Implementation Studies and  Federal Water Resource Investments and guidance included in Departmental Manual (DM) 9500- 013, Guidance for Conducting Analyses Under the Principles, Requirements, and Guidelines for  Water and Land Related Resources Implementation Studies and Federal Water Resource    4 | P a g e     Investments were finalized on January 5, 2017, just days before President Trump\\u2019s inauguration.  Within USDA, this framework will continue to apply to NRCS and will be expanded to include  the USFS, the Farm Service Agency (FSA), and the Rural Utilities Service (RUS). The Interagency  Guidelines (IAG) provides direction to agencies for implementing the concepts included in the  PR&G.  We recommend that DR 9500-13 and the DM be repealed. The process proposed is daunting and  uncertain, and the costs and delays it would impose could preclude many planning and  development efforts. We do not want to see a program that becomes mired in a process that  ultimately delays or prevents implementation of critical water enhancement and conservation  projects. Those projects \\u2013 especially those that enhance water supplies \\u2013 already are very time- intensive and any additional delay for planning and studies will only add to the costs and time  frame for providing water supply relief.  NEPA Processes Associated with Forest Health (regulations at 36 CFR part 220, Forest  Service Manual 1950, and Forest Service Handbook 1909.15)  In recent years \\u2013 catalyzed by the ominous increase in Western wildfire activity - members of  our organization have been seeking ways to discourage litigation against the USFS relating to  land management projects. We also support efforts to develop a categorical exclusion under  NEPA for covered vegetative management activities carried out to establish or improve habitat  for important Western species like greater sage-grouse and mule deer. We seek to expedite and  prioritize forest management activities that achieve ecosystem restoration objectives.   In the world of Western water, a massive wildfire in the headwaters of a watershed can devastate  the water supply \\u2013 both quantity and quality \\u2013 so important to the many beneficial uses in that river  basin, including the irrigation of farms and ranches that produce some of our Nation\\u2019s high-quality  food and fiber. The Alliance believes the federal government must prioritize actions that would  help actually implement some important forest management projects on federal lands to ward off  these disastrous wildfires and protect some of our most vulnerable Western water supplies in the  process.    We do not seek changes that waive or ignore existing federal environmental laws; we simply  want to find administrative ways to make them work better. We support procedural  recommendations transmitted to the USFS NEPA Services Group by California Farm Bureau  Federation on February 2, 2018 that could result in streamlined, effective work rather than costly  litigation:  \\uf0b7 The USFS should allow for large scale, landscape-level land management plans to guide  individual actions on the forest without duplicative administrative process under federal  environmental laws. However, landscape-level analysis and decision making should not  become an unintentionally created \\u201cnew\\u201d planning level which is required to move  forward with project level decisions. The USFS should also prioritize smaller, nimble  projects with shorter analysis timelines.     5 | P a g e     \\uf0b7 USFS should improve and expedite NEPA timelines to streamline post-fire salvage  timber harvest to improve forest health, support rural communities, reduce public safety  risk and maximize salvage timber value.  \\uf0b7 The USFS should direct the use of Categorical Exclusions (CEs) already allowed under  NEPA in preventing wildfires and restoring forest habitat and ecosystems more  effectively and on a timely basis. The Forest Service should specifically expand the  following CEs:  o Increase allowable acreage of live tree harvest from 70 acres to 250 acres, and  increase the allowable length of temporary road construction from one-half mile  to two miles.  o Increase post-fire rehabilitation activities up to 4,200 acres   o Increase the allowable acreage of salvage from 250 to 1,000 acres and increase  the allowable length of temporary road construction from one-half mile to three  miles.  o Increase roadside salvage to an unlimited size in order to protect public safety  and infrastructure from dead and dying hazard trees following wildfire or other  catastrophic event.  \\uf0b7 The USFS should create new CEs for the following:  o Decisions documented in Decision Notices and Findings of No Significant  Impact and should include commercial and non-commercial timber harvest,  hazardous fuels removal, prescribed fire and post-fire restoration.  o Thinning treatments up to 5,000 acres on previously managed forest stand less  than 80-years old.  \\uf0b7 The USFS should utilize exemptions and expedited procedures found in State law or  regulation that would expedite actions to recover fiber, restore, and reforest lands  damaged by wildfire.  \\uf0b7 The USFS should address the economic and environmental effects of doing nothing in  the No-Action alternative. In the West, doing nothing often results in a continued decline  of forest health resulting in catastrophic wildfire and the loss of many resource values  including air and water quality, loss of personal property and even loss of life. The No- Action alternative analysis should describe the trade-off of doing nothing versus any  action alternative and not assume that an unmanaged, untouched forest will remain static  and in proper health.   \\uf0b7 The USFS should adopt emergency procedures to allow rapid response to wildfires and  other events the CEs found in the 2014 Farm Bill for any hazardous fuels reduction project  on Condition Class 2 or 3 lands developed via a collaborative process or develop a new  CE. For example, the Forest Service should expand the designated insect and disease risk  areas to allow for greater use of the 3,000-acre legislative categorical exclusion including  under Section 602 of the Farm Bill.      6 | P a g e     The Family Farm Alliance believes these types of procedural changes to NEPA implementation  would improve our Western landscapes, protect our valuable water supplies from the devastating  effects of wildfires, and allow agencies to improve habitat and restore ecosystems for the benefit  of federally important species to allow continued agricultural use of our public lands.     NEPA Processes Associated with New Water Development Projects (7 CFR PART 1b)  The Family Farm Alliance believes that without new sources of water, increasing urban and  environmental demands will deplete existing agricultural supplies and seriously threaten the  future of Western irrigated agriculture. The often slow and cumbersome federal regulatory  process is a major obstacle to realization of projects and actions that could enhance Western  water supplies.  The Alliance has long worked with Congress, federal agencies and other  interested parties to build a consensus for improving the regulatory process.   NEPA implementation can have a direct bearing on the success or failure of critical water supply  enhancement projects. In recent years, we surveyed irrigators and water managers throughout the  West and asked them to identify the regulatory impediments they most frequently encounter as  they seek to construct projects that enhance water supplies. NEPA \\u201chorror\\u201d stories were  abundant. Below, we list the impediments related to NEPA implementation and offer associated  recommendations on how each can be addressed.    Problem #1: The NEPA process takes too long and is too uncertain and expensive.  NEPA  documents should only pertain to the proposed action and only address issues raised in public  scoping that are directly tied to the proposed action. Instead, a common ploy of certain activist  groups is to throw a \\u201claundry list\\u201d of issues and concerns at a federal agency, knowing full well  it will distract, confuse, and lengthen the process, thereby creating a document with potential  loop holes that might later be appealed.  Anything that can be done to streamline the overall  NEPA process should be encouraged:   \\uf0b7 Develop a reasonable range of alternatives to facilitate project planning and the NEPA  process. We believe alternatives should be limited to the proposed action being analyzed.  The number of alternatives should be constrained only to the range of activities and  associated impacts of the proposed action.      \\uf0b7 USFS should require that \\u201creasonable alternatives\\u201d analyzed in NEPA documents be  limited to those which are economically and technically feasible.     \\uf0b7 Add mandatory timelines and page limits (as established in current NEPA regulations)  for the completion of NEPA documents.      \\uf0b7 Add a requirement that agencies \\u201cpre-clear\\u201d projects. This is the basic function of the CE  that is almost never used because of the test of \\u201csignificant impact\\u201d.       7 | P a g e     \\uf0b7 Encourage cooperative efforts to move projects through the NEPA and permitting  processes: 1) Grant tribal, state and local stakeholders cooperating agency status. The  definition would include the term \\u201cpolitical subdivisions\\u201d to capture the large number of  political subdivisions that provide vital services to the public but are generally ignored in  the planning for NEPA; and 2) Encourage more consultation with stakeholders.      \\uf0b7 Control NEPA-related costs.   Problem #2: The alternatives proposed for assessment by NEPA regulators are frequently  inappropriate, unrealistic, difficult-to-implement, and often in conflict with state law. For  example, \\u201cpurpose and need\\u201d requirements related to potential benefits or uses of future water  supplies are dismissed by agency regulators in NEPA. Planning opportunities and purposes for  which a project may be permitted are restricted, which narrows the planning horizon, and makes  it impossible to plan for projects with long-term benefits.  We offer USFS six recommendations  to address this and other concerns:   \\uf0b7 Create unambiguous criteria for the use of CEs, Environmental Assessments (EA) and  Environmental Impact Statements (EIS). As these criteria are clarified, it will force  policymakers to also address the confusion that currently exists relative to what exactly  constitutes a \\u201csignificant\\u201d impact. The definition of \\u201csignificant impact to the human  environment\\u201d needs to be clarified to minimize confusion and varying interpretations  between various local and regional federal agency staff. Ultimately, proper  implementation of this recommendation has the potential to reduce future litigation costs.   \\uf0b7 Require that the alternative analysis must include consideration of the environmental  impact of not taking an action on any proposed project.    \\uf0b7 Prepare regulations giving weight to localized comments;     \\uf0b7 Promulgate regulations to make clear which types of future actions are appropriate for  consideration under the cumulative impact analysis.   \\uf0b7 The state\\u2019s legislative and planning process should be considered in establishing  \\u201cpurpose and need\\u201d for construction of dam and reservoir projects.  Revised regulations  should allow existing state environmental review process to satisfy NEPA requirements.    Problem #3: Federal regulators take a long time making decisions on projects, and at times  they seem unable to even make decisions. Recommendations:   \\uf0b7 We have previously recommended and maintain our view that an EIS should normally  be less than 150 pages with a maximum of 300 pages for complex projects. And,  timelines should be no more than one year from NOI to final EIS.  These strict page  limits and timelines can be accomplished with more up-front planning and outreach work  to ensure a more orderly and organized process for crafting concise, well written NEPA  documents that will stand the test of any challenges.    \\uf0b7 Conduct a study and report that details the amount and experience of NEPA staff at  USFS.  A consistent problem noted by several Western water users who have worked in  NEPA processes are decisions made by the lead agency staff, who, due to perceived bias    8 | P a g e     or lack of ability to adequately administer NEPA, routinely and habitually instigate  \\u201cpredecisional\\u201d actions.    Problem #4: Federal fisheries agencies like Fish and Wildlife Service and National Marine  Fisheries Service are not compelled to consult with other agencies like USFS in a timely  fashion, and frequently do not begin work on Endangered Species Act (ESA) biological  opinions until after the NEPA process has been completed.      \\uf0b7 To reap the maximum benefit of lead agencies, we recommend that their authorities  should be applied \\u201chorizontally\\u201d to cover all cases. Additional concepts would be added  such as charging the lead agency with the responsibility to develop a consolidated record  for the NEPA reviews, EIS development, and other NEPA decisions.    Problem #5: The positive attributes and importance of agricultural activities are often not  properly assessed in NEPA analyses, if they are assessed at all. Recommendations:    \\uf0b7 NEPA analyses should require that value be assigned to continued agricultural  production in a project area.  \\uf0b7 Impacts of drought and continuing water demands must be assessed and built into the  NEPA process.   This matter is very important to the family farmers and ranchers of our membership. We are  hopeful that a concerted good-faith effort to address NEPA administration will result in a  streamlined regulatory process that will be efficient, fair and effective.      2015 Clean Water Rule \\u2013 \\u201cWaters of the U.S.\\u201d (80 FR 37054, June 29, 2015)  The 2015 Obama Administration \\u201cClean Water Rule\\u201d adopted by EPA and the Army Corps of  Engineers (Corps), intended to clarify administration of the Clean Water Act (CWA)  jurisdictional issues, which are very uncertain, particularly in areas where Western farmers and  ranchers store, move and apply water for irrigation. This uncertainty brings with it the risk of  additional regulations, time-consuming and potentially expensive procedures, expanded  opportunities for litigation, and a shift from local and state water management towards increased  federal agency regulation and oversight. The Obama-era \\u201cClean Water Rule\\u201d proposed certain  excluded waters and exempted activities in determining what is to be considered per se \\u201cwaters  of the U.S.\\u201d, or through case specific analyses of \\u201cother waters\\u201d. These are ambiguous and will  create uncertainty in implementing the CWA. Our farmers and ranchers simply do not need  another layer of difficulty added to a profession that is already saddled with significant  challenges.   The CWA itself contains broad exemptions from regulation for the agricultural sector in rural  America. Farmers and ranchers currently do not need CWA Section 404 dredge and fill permits  for normal farming practices like plowing or constructing farm roads. In addition, stormwater  runoff and irrigated agricultural return flows from farm fields are not subject to federal pollution    9 | P a g e     permits.  The agencies said these exemptions would be carried forward under the 2015 rule and  issued (and subsequently withdrew) an \\\"interpretive rule\\\" to explain dredge-and-fill exemptions  for normal farming, silviculture, and ranching practices, listing 56 conservation practices  approved by the USDA-NRCS that would be exempt from permitting requirements under  Section 404 of the CWA.    The Alliance believes that the interpretive rule would not have protected farmers from  requirements related to potential pollutant discharges and future permitting requirements under  the CWA, and would actually narrow the exemptions for production agriculture under the CWA.  The interpretive rule as proposed also placed the USDA-NRCS in a position of policing these  practices under the CWA rather than their usual role of partnering with agriculture to ensure the  adoption of best practices important to the balance of productive farms and ranches and clean  water.     NRCS and EPA should collaborate with the agricultural sector to ensure that all normal farming,  silviculture, and ranching practices, including USDA-NRCS approved practices continue to be  exempt from CWA regulation. There are existing examples of similar inter-agency collaboration.  The EPA and the Corps in July 2007 issued Regulatory Guidance Letter (RGL) 07-02 that  provides a national approach for conducting exemption determinations for the construction and  maintenance of irrigation ditches and the maintenance of drainage ditches consistent with  Section 404(f) of the CWA.  Section 404(f) specifically exempts from CWA permitting  requirements discharges of dredged or fill material into \\u201cwaters of the U.S.\\u201d associated with the  construction and maintenance of irrigation ditches and maintenance of drainage ditches.   The EPA and the Corps have used this RGL to interpret these CWA exemptions in many cases in  the West; fortunately, the Trump Administration\\u2019s intent to move forward with a new, revised  WOTUS2 rulemaking provides an opportunity to further strengthen the CWA exemptions. The  Administration\\u2019s emphasis on the Scalia test provides an opportunity to clearly draw a bright line  that limits jurisdiction of the CWA to waters that permanently flow year-round, or most of the  year. It would also limit jurisdiction to those locations where visual surface flow connections can  be made between wetlands and navigable waters that flow year-round or most of the year.  It  further provides an opportunity to clearly articulate existing CWA exemptions for agricultural  and roadside ditches, irrigation drains, farming operations, farm runoff.   The Obama WOTUS Rule excludes \\u201c[a]rtificially irrigated areas that would revert to dry land  should application of water to that area cease.\\u201d  In RGL 07-02, the Corps explained that wetlands  \\u201cestablished solely due to the presence of irrigation water, irrigated fields, or irrigation ditches\\u201d  are not jurisdictional.  An accompanying footnote further clarified that \\u201cwaters, including  wetlands, created as a result of irrigation would not be considered waters of the United States  even when augmented on occasion by precipitation.\\u201d1                                                                1  Id. at note 1.  Under the reasoning in RGL 07-02, it appears that irrigation ditches could be tributaries \\u201csolely due  to the presence of irrigation water.\\u201d    10 | P a g e     We conclude this section by emphasizing that exemption from federal regulation does not imply  a complete lack of regulatory oversight. States, such as California, can and are regulating such  activities under waivers or waste discharge requirements and, as needed, through stream  alteration permits.  NRCS Water Conservation Programs (7 CFR Chapter VI)  Today, irrigated agriculture in the American west faces some of the most vexing and complex  challenges in addressing crucial water quantity and quality issues.  Water is the lifeblood of  irrigated agriculture in the West, and the ever-growing competing demands for water many times  outstrips the available supply, setting up conflict between farmers and cities, the environment  and even between other farmers over limited and uncertain irrigation water supplies. Given the  increasing importance of growing a safe, stable supply of abundant food for this Nation and the  world, we must continue to manage and protect these limited water supplies necessary to  adequately and efficiently irrigate Western crops so important to meeting this goal.  And,  through the Farm Bill conservation programs administered by NRCS, necessary water and  natural resource conservation and management tools and partnerships are made available to  farmers and ranchers that can help them to successfully meet these challenges.   The Alliance believes that, by utilizing the examples of successful American food and fiber  producers, private landowners, and on-the-ground conservation practitioners, NRCS has a unique  opportunity to make Farm Bill Title II conservation programs more effective, more efficient, and  more user-friendly. This is especially important now, with the tough budget times we are facing  and will continue to face in the near future.     The Alliance supports incentive-driven conservation programs, more local and state control of  the funding for those programs, increased emphasis on deteriorating forested watersheds, and  streamlined implementation.  We believe the practical experience of our membership, coupled  with the many agricultural water and natural resource policy issues our organization has been  involved with over the past several years gives us a unique perspective to provide specific ideas  on how conservation programs can be delivered more efficiently and encourage more  participation from Western farmers and ranchers. The Alliance has long supported robust and  reliable funding for the Environmental Quality Incentives Program (EQIP), the Regional  Conservation Partnership Program (RCPP), and the Watershed Protection and Flood Prevention  program (P.L. 566).    For more than 75 years, American taxpayers have invested in conservation through the Farm  Bill. These investments in private lands and waters have delivered cost-effective benefits far  beyond the property lines of farmers and ranchers, extending robust returns for every taxpayer  who buys food at the market, enjoys fresh air and clean water, and recreates in the great  outdoors.  These returns include significantly improved fish and wildlife habitat, improved air,  soil and water quality, ensured long-term productivity of our agricultural lands, increased  outdoor recreational opportunities, and increased financial returns for rural communities.        11 | P a g e     In the Western U.S., we need policies that encourage agricultural producers to work together  with each other and with many applicable Federal and State agencies in a strategic, coordinated  fashion.  This is especially true now more than ever before due to the limited financial resources  of the Federal government and the need to continue to effectively and efficiently protect our  limited natural resources so important to this Nation\\u2019s food productivity.     We must create to further improve upon delivery of important Farm Bill conservation funding to  provide the \\u201cbest bang for the buck\\u201d on farm and ranch lands:    \\u2022  New Farm Bill provisions should be enacted to allow EQIP to provide direct payments to  irrigation districts to work directly with their landowner member farmers on NRCS-approved  coordinated water conservation and management projects. While NRCS should still approve  the contracts, we believe more efficient results that provide measurable, coordinated  improvements on the ground will occur if the irrigation districts distribute the funds and  work with the landowners directly. These districts can provide opportunities for innovative  solutions to water management problems that currently cannot be achieved simply due to  bureaucratic barriers, lack of communication and narrowly focused programs. Administrative  expenses for such partners should be allowed, but capped;    \\u2022  Irrigation districts and/or landowners should be allowed to implement water conservation or  water quality projects outside of the normal projects funded under the EQIP program, given  that they can show improvements to either water quantity or quality;   \\u2022  Irrigation districts or similar entities should be allowed to be the basis for \\u201cpooling\\u201d  arrangements, where the benefits of a project which affects multiple landowners is funded by  \\u201cpooling\\u201d their individual EQIP interests into a larger, coordinated project;    \\u2022  Direction must be provided to improve how NRCS program administrators deliver timely  and accurate information, provide reliable and transparent processes, and set firm deadlines;    \\u2022  Administrative costs associated with any work performed by the NRCS should be capped at  a reasonable level;     \\u2022  The role of the Bureau of Reclamation in coordinating with NRCS in the implementation of  water conservation programs in Western states must be well defined, and should complement  the collaborative philosophy (between the Departments of Agriculture and the Interior)  embedded in the \\u201cBridging the Headgates\\u201d initiative endorsed by both the Bush 41 and 43,  and Clinton Administrations;     \\u2022  NRCS conservation programs should provide assurances that the intent is not to reallocate  water away from agriculture, but to help stretch limited water supplies for future regional  beneficial use. We do not believe Farm Bill funds should be used to retire farmland or  convert irrigated ground to dryland crops. It must also recognize the traditional deference of  federal agencies to state water laws and allocation systems;        12 | P a g e     \\u2022  Water managers have also noticed that the NRCS funding levels fluctuate, and so they are  never sure what level of funding their farmers will receive. During the application process to  secure funding, NRCS should agree how much a district is going to receive and ensure this  money will be there. To minimize administrative complications, sharing some of the control  over funds with the partnering irrigation districts would simplify the responsibilities of the  NRCS. Districts could be held accountable through audits and reports delivered to the  NRCS.   \\u2022  We would be happy to sit down with committee staff and NRCS leadership to help create a  workable and efficient solution to these challenges.   Local and state priorities should be the drivers of conservation. One size does not fit all.   Conservation needs of a rice farm in Arkansas are much different than those of a rancher in  Wyoming or a coffee producer in Hawaii. Local control for identification of conservation needs  and allocation of funding must be restored.  We believe the national priority ranking criteria  should be completely eliminated, and instead, a block of conservation funds should be provided  to each state, where local and state priorities end up driving how funds are spent on the ground,  consistent with each program\\u2019s authorities and goals.  States should be allowed to voluntarily  assume primacy for implementation of the conservation title of the Farm Bill with block grants  to the states. This would result in increased efficiency and delivery of conservation needs within  each state.    Most state have mirror agencies, Departments of Agriculture, Wildlife, Natural Resources, and  Engineers that have the capacity to implement conservation programs. This type of approach is  already in place for portions of the Clean Water Act. Significant cost saving to the federal  government could be realized by reduction in duplicate effort with the states.   We look forward to working with your Department to embed these concepts into actual  administration of NRCS conservation programs.    Conclusions    Western irrigated agriculture is a strategic and irreplaceable national resource. It must be  protected by the federal government in the 21st Century. Recognizing the value of Western  irrigated agriculture is vital. Properly managing federal watersheds and encouraging federal  agencies to work with the agricultural community to solve local water challenges are imperative.  Farmers and ranchers and others in the regulated community saw increased Federal top-down  regulations and controls being proposed and put in place during the prior administration;  meanwhile, proven, collaborative partnership-driven approaches to find lasting solutions to  vexing water problems were put on the back burner. It is difficult to understand why agricultural  production finds itself continually under attack when farmers and ranchers continue to provide  the affordable food and fiber to feed and clothe the Nation and the world.     13 | P a g e     Thank you for this opportunity to provide input on this matter, which is very important to the  family farmers and ranchers of our membership. We are hopeful that a concerted good-faith  effort to address the issues discussed above will result in streamlined regulatory processes that  will be efficient, fair and effective.   We look forward to working with you toward that goal.   Please do not hesitate to contact me at dan@familyfarmalliance.org  if you have questions  regarding this letter.     Sincerely,          Dan Keppen   Executive Director     \"}"
